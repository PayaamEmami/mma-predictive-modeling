## Completed Experiments

<!-- EXPERIMENTS_LIST_START -->

_No experiments completed yet. Run your first experiment to populate this list!_

<!-- EXPERIMENTS_LIST_END -->

## How This Works

When an experiment completes and generates `experiment_report.md`, this file is automatically updated to include a link and summary of that experiment. The list above is maintained between the `<!-- EXPERIMENTS_LIST_START -->` and `<!-- EXPERIMENTS_LIST_END -->` markers.
