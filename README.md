# MMA Predictive Modeling

MMA Predictive Modeling (MPM) is an advanced machine learning system that predicts Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fight outcomes using ensemble methods and comprehensive statistical analysis. This project combines classical machine learning algorithms, deep neural networks, and modern ensemble techniques to analyze fighter performance data and generate intelligent predictions for upcoming MMA events.

Built with Python using frameworks including scikit-learn and PyTorch, the system features automated data processing, model training, and real-time inference capabilities. The architecture maintains all fight data in structured CSV format for efficient updates and management, while generating comprehensive visualizations including model comparison charts, learning curves, and detailed performance analytics.

MMA fight prediction is, in theory, a well-posed input-output problem: given data, output a prediction (e.g., Fighter A wins or Fighter B wins). However, in practice, accurate fight prediction is extremely challenging. Real-world outcomes depend on human behavior (which is non-deterministic and chaotic), incomplete data (such as injuries, mindset, or training changes), and inherent randomness (like lucky punches or judging errors). This introduces uncertainty and irreducible complexity, making perfect prediction impossible. MMA fight prediction is practically intractable to solve perfectly. No model can guarantee perfect accuracy due to real-world randomness and incomplete information.

## Project Overview

This comprehensive machine learning system employs a diverse array of algorithms and sophisticated data processing techniques to analyze MMA fight outcomes. The project combines traditional statistical methods with modern deep learning approaches to create robust predictive models.

### ðŸ§  **Machine Learning Models**

The system implements **9 distinct algorithms** across multiple paradigms for comprehensive predictive analysis:

- **Classical ML:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees
- **Neural Networks:** Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN), Transformers
- **Ensemble Methods:** Gradient Boosting, Random Forest

Each model contributes unique strengths to the ensemble, from the interpretability of decision trees to the pattern recognition capabilities of neural networks.

### ðŸ“Š **Data Processing & Feature Engineering**

The data pipeline transforms raw fight statistics into meaningful predictive features through:

- **Multi-source data extraction:** Fighter profiles, historical performance metrics, and event-specific contextual data
- **Advanced feature engineering:** Derivation of key performance indicators including striking accuracy, takedown defense rates, fight finish percentages, and momentum-based metrics
- **Intelligent preprocessing:** Automated handling of missing values, feature normalization, and outlier detection to ensure robust model training
- **Temporal analysis:** Integration of career progression trends and recent performance patterns

### ðŸŽ¯ **Training & Model Evaluation**

The training framework ensures rigorous model development and validation:

- **Comparative analysis:** Systematic evaluation across all 9 algorithms using consistent training protocols
- **Comprehensive datasets:** Models trained on extensive historical fight data with careful train/validation/test splits
- **Performance visualization:** Generation of detailed learning curves and accuracy progression plots
- **Multi-metric evaluation:** Assessment using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- **Cross-validation:** Robust validation strategies to ensure generalization and prevent overfitting
