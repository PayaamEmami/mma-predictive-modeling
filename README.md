# MMA Predictive Modeling

MMA Predictive Modeling (MPM) is a machine learning system designed to predict Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fight outcomes by combining classical algorithms and deep neural networks. It processes detailed fighter performance data to deliver data-driven predictions for upcoming events.

MMA fight prediction is, in theory, a well-posed input-output problem: given data, output a prediction (e.g., Fighter A wins or Fighter B wins). However, in practice, accurate fight prediction is extremely challenging. Real-world outcomes depend on human behavior (which is non-deterministic and chaotic), incomplete data (such as injuries, mindset, or training changes), and inherent randomness (like lucky punches or judging errors). This introduces uncertainty and irreducible complexity, making perfect prediction impossible. MMA fight prediction is practically intractable to solve perfectly. No model can guarantee perfect accuracy due to real-world randomness and incomplete information.

## Project Overview

This machine learning system analyzes fighter performance data using classical algorithms, deep learning models, and robust data processing techniques to predict MMA fight outcomes. Developed in Python with scikit-learn and PyTorch, it automates data processing, model training, and real-time inference.

### ðŸ§  **Machine Learning Models**

The system implements **9 distinct algorithms** across multiple paradigms for comprehensive predictive analysis:

- **Classical ML:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees
- **Neural Networks:** Feedforward Neural Network (FNN), Transformers
- **Ensemble Methods:** Gradient Boosting, Random Forest

Each model contributes unique strengths to the multi-model system, from the interpretability of decision trees to the pattern recognition capabilities of neural networks.

### ðŸ“Š **Data Processing & Feature Engineering**

The data pipeline transforms raw fight statistics into meaningful predictive features through:

- **Multi-source data extraction:** Fighter profiles, historical performance metrics, and event-specific contextual data
- **Feature engineering:** Derivation of key performance indicators including striking accuracy, takedown defense rates, fight finish percentages, and momentum-based metrics
- **Preprocessing:** Automated handling of missing values, feature normalization, and outlier detection to ensure robust model training

### ðŸŽ¯ **Training & Model Evaluation**

The training framework ensures rigorous model development and validation:

- **Comparative analysis:** Systematic evaluation across all 9 algorithms using consistent training protocols
- **Comprehensive datasets:** Models trained on extensive historical fight data with careful train/validation/test splits
- **Performance visualization:** Generation of detailed learning curves and accuracy progression plots
- **Multi-metric evaluation:** Assessment using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- **Cross-validation:** Robust validation strategies to ensure generalization and prevent overfitting

## Automated ML Pipeline
